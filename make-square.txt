Primitive Aluminum Forging – Optimized Workflow

Prep time: Several hours (including fire and charcoal)
Skill level: Beginner (adult supervision recommended)
Materials & Tools:
1. Rusty scrap iron/steel (for sparks and tools)
2. Aluminum pieces (for forging)
3. Hard rocks (for hammer and anvil)
4. Flint or quartz (fire striker)
5. Sticks and wood (kindling, firewood, charcoal)
6. Dry leaves or tinder
7. Dirt and stones (for pits, forge, and fire containment)
8. Optional: gloves, jacket, eye protection

Step 1: Gather Everything First
1. Collect all materials and tools listed above.
2. Ensures you won't have to run around while fires are burning.
3. Helps you plan placement of pits, forge, and charcoal oven safely.

Step 2: Prepare Tools
1. Shape flat rock to use as hammer.
2. Choose flat rock to use as anvil.
3. Make primitive tongs from sticks or hooks.
4. Sharpen flint or quartz for fire-starting.

Step 3: Build Fire and Charcoal Oven
1. Dig a small tinder hole.
2. Place dry leaves and kindling in the hole.
3. Strike flint + iron to produce sparks until tinder ignites.
4. Gradually add sticks to build small fire.
5. Dig charcoal pit nearby.
6. Place burning sticks from fire into charcoal pit.
7. Cover with dirt or rocks, leaving a tiny vent for smoke.
8. Let wood smolder until it becomes charcoal (black, brittle).

Step 4: Build Forge
1. Dig shallow pit near flat rock anvil.
2. Fill pit with charcoal as fuel.
3. Light charcoal using small fire from Step 3.

Step 5: Heat and Forge Aluminum
1. Place aluminum pieces carefully into the hot charcoal forge.
2. Lift hot aluminum using sticks/tongs.
3. Place on flat rock anvil.
4. Hammer gently with flat rock hammer into square shape.
5. Reheat as needed and continue hammering until desired shape is achieved.

Step 6: Finish and Clean
1. Let aluminum cool safely in dirt or on rock.
2. Optional: carve or stamp designs (like “hi”) into surface.
3. Extinguish all fires, cover pits, and clean work area.

Safety Notes
1. Always assume hot metal will burn instantly.
2. Keep water, sand, or dirt nearby for emergencies.
3. Wear thick jacket, gloves, long sleeves, and eye protection.
4. Move slowly and deliberately when handling hot aluminum.
5. Plan all movements before lifting or striking metal.
